ðŸ™Œ  Hello World! I'm @pedrohtr89, nice to meet you all!  ðŸ™Œ

Currently I'm trying to learn how to code, mostly C++ (I have a litle base) and Python (I'm really new to this one).                                            
Hope my learning goes well and have lots of fun!

You can reach me on Instagram @pedrohtr89

Thanks for passing by! Bye!
